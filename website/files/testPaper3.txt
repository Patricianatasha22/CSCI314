WHAT FOOD DOES A CAMEL EAT?

Camels come in two types: dromedary or one-hump camels and bactrian or two-hump camels. The bactrian is native to Central Asia, while the dromedary comes from the Middle East and northern Africa. Both species have very similar diets and eating habits, regardless of where they live.

Camels are herbivores and will graze—eat constantly throughout the day—just as sheep do. Camels are also ruminants, which means they eat food, then regurgitate it and chew it before swallowing one last time. This is why camels have four stomachs, to help them process food properly. Because they live in the desert, where food might be scarce, they move constantly while eating. This actually helps preserve vegetation so no area is completely degraded by constant eating.
